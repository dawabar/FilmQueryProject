# FilmQuery Application

### Description

This project makes a JDBC connection to the classic Sakila film rental database, using MySQL for database storage across a MAMP instance running on a local machine.  Java classes use SQL to query for results from the database, based on choices from a menu in the console.


Topics covered in Week 7:

- Web Basics, incuding:
	- HTML,  
	- CSS,  
	- Bootstrap, and  
	- creating an AWS EC2 instance and a localhost Apache server  
- Relational Databases
- MAMP/LAMP/WAMP (MAMP installed)
- SQL Queries and Functions, with a focus on MySQL
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Java Database Connections (JDBC)
- Maven (dependency control)

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Eclipse
- Maven
- Apache web server
- MySQL
- Git
- GitHub
- Markdown (for README.md)
- Slack
- Zoom
- Browser (Chrome-focused)
- Unix/Linux Terminal

### Lessons Learned

I plunged straight into writing code, since there was a lot of framework provided for us and the rest of the code seemed relatively straightforward based on the User Stories provided.

At one point, I almost tried to refactor my database connectivity.  Each database query repeats code to establish a connection, build a unique SQL query, return results, and then close the connection.  I had wanted to make things more DRY, but after running into an issue with this, an advisor recommended leaving the provided code as-is instead of working through the refactoring issues.

SQL went smoothly this week for me.  I've been working with SQL in one way or another for over 15 years -- including recent exposure to Qlik, Snowflake, and Ataccama and previous experience using ElasticSearch, Oracle database queries, and NoSQL queries (atomic queries).  Still, I learned a lot of new material throughout that part of the course.

HTML and CSS exposure was mostly a review for me, but the Bootstrap training was new and amazing.  There's so much complexity, but I also see how it keeps code consistent and enforces formatting for pages, enabling devs to scale up a site without refactoring code on every page.

My code is becoming cleaner and faster.  Fluency is expanding nicely.  At the same time, I spent a while this week practicing Codewars with some classmates.  Seeing both the beautiful and complex approaches that other Codewars users have created revealed to me that I have a lot to learn still.  The most powerful tools I saw were methods called from static Java classes like Array or Integer, but Method Chaining is also an area in which I plan to focus after this course is over.

Next week will be our mid-term project.  We will build a full-stack app for the first time.  While I'm not the fastest programmer in the course, I'm also not the slowest.  I find that my code is generally reliable when I write it, and the problems I have are either small mistakes or easy fixes in the basic logic. I believe I will contribute effectively to whatever team I'm assigned.  I hope I will be able to bring my past project-management skills into the planning stages as we begin, so that creating a finished product will go much smoother and allow for more debugging and polishing at the end.  Just like the 80/20 Pareto Rule, we will probably have a basic framework quickly but need additional time at the end to work out little details.  Knowing that "slow is smooth, and smooth is fast," I'll work in the coming week to prepare for the planning stages and get ready to map the project ahead of any execution.

This was a good week.  Lots of learning, lots of experience, lots of confidence building.
